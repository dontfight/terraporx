# Hashi-Porx on Vagrant

This directory contains a test environment for bringing up Portworx
under Nomad and Consul.

This is ONLY intended for Demos, POCs and Testing, 
since both consul and nomad run in "-dev" mode on a 3 node VM cluster.

This environment has been tested on 16GB server.

## ToDo
Add vault
